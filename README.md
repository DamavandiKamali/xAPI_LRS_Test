Experience API LRS Test
=============

## Policies and Procedures for Conformance Testing Group:

# Goal

This group exists to create a single conformance test to be used as the official Experience API 
(xAPI) v1.0.1 conformance test.  This test will have the backing of the Advanced Distributed 
Learning (ADL) Initiative.

# Conformance Test Scope

* The conformance test will test ONLY an LRS and test ONLY mandatory requirements within the xAPI Specification.
* An LRS that passes this conformance test can and should be used to test conformance of content/clients of xAPI.

# Conformance Testing Requirments Document

* All conformance requirements will be listed in the Testing Requirements (TR) document in a means which tests/documents can refer to a specific requirement number.
* All conformance requirements in the TR document will link directly to the specification by section and requirement # within that section.
